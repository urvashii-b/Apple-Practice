Typescript - Superset of Javascript: 
    adds static typing which helps in catching errors earlier in the development process

React - Javascript library:
    building dynamic and interactive user interfaces
    by Facebook in 2011
Angular, Vue - Frameworks

Library: a tool that provides specific functionality
Framework: set of tools and guidelines for building apps

When a webpage is loaded in a browser, it takes html code and creates the document object model (dom)
this allows us to change the content based on user actions

vanilla javascript - without any third party tools (querying and updating)
react - small reusable components (modular and better organized code)

react 'app' (root bringing everything together) - tree of components

--------------------------------------------------------

2 ways to create a react app - 1. CRA, 2. Vite

node-modules: all third party libraries and tools are installed (no need to touch this)
public folder: all assets like images and video files are present here
App (single) component in src folder
main.tsx in src folder: entry point of application
index.html: div with id of root - container of application
package.json: details about the project (name, version, scripts, dependencies, dev dependencies that are not going to be deployed in the future)
tsconfig.json: tells typescript compiler how to compile our code to javascript
vite.config.ts: configuration file for vite

use .ts for plain typescript files 
use .tsx for react components

recommended: function based components for new projects

react-dom: updates actual dom after lookign at virtual dom

react is platform agnostic: can be used to build mobile (react native) and web applications

ecosystem:
    ui (react)
    routing - going from pone place to another
    http - calls
    managing app state
    internationalization
    form validation
    animations
